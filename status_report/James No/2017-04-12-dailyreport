Mid-Tier Team

1. Worked with group to iron out our user stories, along with tech to
   research and possibly utilize in the future (survey.js, SQLite functions)

2. Reformatting user stories to be more readable, planning to meet with group
   on Thursday 4/13 to further refine user stories

3. One of the user stories (Tool-Tip Features) looks to be very complicated
   in how we could make a simple implementation of. It will be our last user
   story that we currently are planning to work on.
