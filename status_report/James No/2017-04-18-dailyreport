Mid-Tier Team

1. Moved to my new place in Edmonds, finally got internet on Sunday night.
Read Ghebre's notes on the user stories, plan to revise some formatting
and add some smaller user stories.

2. Preparing for the meeting, framing how to develop alongside front-end
and back-end teams.

3. Hope to balance out all the work in my home after working on project
user stories.
