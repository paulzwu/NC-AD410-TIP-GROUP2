Status Report #5

Mid-Tier Team

1. After discussing with team about our user stories (and receiving Slack
notifications from Mark & Kari about format) I will be continuing to refine
user stories to make concrete acceptance criteria. We will be working on the
feedback/email form as our first sprint project, and I will be working on the
PDO script to grab the admin email from the database.

2. Will be meeting with mid-team today to discuss any further developments; Joe
was talking about how the mail() function in PHP requires a domain, will be
hearing more about it from him. Will continue to discuss implementation
of survey.js, and other possible libraries to utilize for the TIP Editor.

3. Had a rough time with the Android assignment for the other class, took time
away from my research. But I finished last night, and will be able to resume
building the PDO script.
