Mid-Tier Team

1. Car battery died on Thursday 4/20, unfortunately wasn't able to meet with team to
discuss further developments. Been working on the SELECT operation for
retrieving the email from the database.

2. Will plan on working on the epics, then breaking down the user stories.

3. The Select operation for PHP with SQLite3 seems very terse, some acronyms
aren't that intuitive and I have to read more to make sure the script will
run correctly.
