tasks:
1. yesterday, started work on sprint1 - feedback/email page

2. today, finished adding mail function to feedback.php; added code to display what the user typed in the form

roadblock:
1. the email submission is untested. we need access to a mail server (data like smtp server info, etc); it would be preferable if we could find out what the canvas server uses to send emails and hook into that

2. james was going to add a function to pull the user's email from a db. once that is added, sprint1 should be finished for mid-tier group
