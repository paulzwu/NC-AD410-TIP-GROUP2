1) Yesterday I finished up my portion of the website mockup, and finished detailing implementation notes that came to mind while creating the mockup.

2) Tomorrow I plan on reviewing what should be done for the next sprint with the group at our weekly scrum meeting / compiling all of our mockups to one spot for the project wiki

3) We need an organized way to get feedback for mockups, and determine exact implementation details.
