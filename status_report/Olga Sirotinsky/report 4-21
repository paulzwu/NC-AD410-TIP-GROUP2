Olga Sirotinsky status report 4-21-2017

1) front end group has decided to use smarty template for populating front end html pages. 

2) to do: research smarty syntax. I have been assigned to build nav bars for admin/faculty as well as footer templates. 

3) my only road block here is learning how to use smarty and hopefully get these templates done by tuesdays group meet.
