Status report 4/19/2017

1) completed - meeting with group on tuesday went well. Worked on a few user stories for trello. 

2) will work on - framework research for front end. meet with front end to decide which frame work to choose, 
and begin developing shell. Will try also to continue user story additions in trello dont think they are finished yet. 

3) the only hurdle is deciding what framework to use and if it is something we are 
unfamiliar with then we all have to learn format/syntax etc. This is supposed to make it easier for us to devlop html pages.
