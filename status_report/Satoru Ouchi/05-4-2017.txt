Status Report 10

1. Yesterday I worked on other projects. 

2. Today I attended a meeting to see what I can do by next week Tuesday.

3. Tomorrow I will start on coding a helper file that inserts the JSON data into the DB. The roadblock I'm facing is time. 
I am moving pretty soon so time management is a deiciding factor in doing this task.
